## Required Packages

`PyQT6`, `Anthropic`, `AI21`, `Cohere`, `Mistral`, `OpenAI`, `google-genai`, `PySide6`, `Cryptography`, `requests`

## Themes

Dark, Light, and Special Dark

Note: Some themes are slightly broken, I do intend on fixing them but not yet.

## Notes about Providers

Some providers use credits which costs money, although some have free tiers like Cohere, Mistral, and Google. Note that these do come with rate limits to avoid abuse. While this code does store the API keys in the OS itself, do not use this in a enviornment where key leakage is fatal, secondly don't expect this to be truly secure, it's just meant for personal use. Results vary by LLM used.

## Why I made this?

Google translate is kind of bad, DeepL takes too long, and LLMs can take context into account.
